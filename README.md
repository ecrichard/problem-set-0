This is a problem set to help you learn how to use loops. Make sure you use the correct loop if specified.
How this will be graded: 5 points per problem. To earn each point the method will have to print the correct thing based on the input.
If what is printed out is wrong you don't get the point. If it ever crashed then you get no points for that problem.
Start by making a new java project called pset0 and uploading the skeleton code file into src.

1. Create a method that uses a while loop to print numbers from 0 to a positive input(inclusive). Use a while loop.
For example, lister(3); would print: 
0
1
2
3

2. Create a method that prints a message a certain number of times given the input. Make sure the input is positive.
If it is no then print a message to try again. Use a for loop
For example, repeat(3); would print:
hello
hello
hello

3. Create a method that takes a list of ints and pints out the list without the negative numbers. You choose the type of loop.
For example, max(2,7,3,1); would print:
7

4. Create a method that can take a list of ints and prints out the list without the negative numbers. You choose the type of loop.
For example, noNegatives(-2,4,-3,2); would print:
[4,2]

5. Create a method that takes a list of ints and prints out the list with each of the original values multiplied by itself, added to 10,
then multiplied by 3. You choose the type of loop.
For example, newList(1,2,3); would print:
[33,42,57]

6. Create a method that takes a string and prints a string without letters that are repeated consecutively. 
For example, noMultiples("hello"); would print:
helo
